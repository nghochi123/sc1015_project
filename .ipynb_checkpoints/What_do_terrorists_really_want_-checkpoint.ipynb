However, it is still significant enough for us to draw analysis.\n",

We can see that terrorists usually attack civilians to maximise their political gains (as we can see the political category having the highest number of datapoints = 966). Perhaps it's to make a statement and coming from a place of wanting to be heard. Although the models created were not exactly extremely accurate when determining the categories, being able to use LDA to determine the most common frequencies of words really helps us to understand the motives better, and hence group them under 6 topic labels. \n",
